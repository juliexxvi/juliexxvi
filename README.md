### Hi there, I'm Julie 👋

## I'm an Apprentice Developer

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a simple e-commerce website where the user can add products to the cart and purchase them
- 🌱 I’m teaching myself NodeJS and web development
- 💻 I have some small projects in my public repositories, let's check it out
- 🥅 2022 Goal: Get my very first job as a software developer 🙏
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently working as an accountant, however, I am passionate about software development so I've been spending a lot of time teaching myself programming skills. Also, I'm proud to be an apprentice software developer of General Assembly 😁
